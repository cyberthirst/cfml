 * If we use the run action then the program should act as following:

 *  2. interpret the bytecode
 *  - we want the compiler and the interpreter to share the same structures (e.g. the constant pool)
 *  - it would be inefficient to output the bytecode to file and then read it again
 *  - this files defines the shared structures
